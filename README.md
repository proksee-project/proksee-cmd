# Proksee

Proksee is a suite of command line tools for performing assembly and evaluation of microbial genomes.

## Release

v1.0.0a6

- Modifies the Mash database download procedure to write less output.
- Correctly instructs QUAST to use the user-specified minimum contig size.
- Better handling of Mash for species estimation of large assemblies with many contigs.
- Mash may now be run using parallelization.
- Removed possible security vulnerabilities when running subprocesses.
- Better user input checking.

## Installation

Proksee requires the following packages:

- Python 3.7
- Pip
- fastp
- Skesa
- Mash
- Quast
- Scipy
- Spades
- wget
 
This can be accomplished by installing dependencies into a conda environment, using the provided installation script as follows:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate proksee
```

Proksee can then be installed by running the setup script (when inside the Proksee directory):

```bash
pip install .
```

Finally, download and install the Mash sketch database required by Proksee by running:

```bash
proksee updatedb
```

## Assemble

The assemble pipeline consists of three major stages:

- **Stage 1: Pre-Assembly**: Verifies inputs, estimates information about the reads, filters the reads, and prepares the reads for sequence assembly.
- **Stage 2: Fast Assembly**: Assembles the reads quickly in order to derive approximate information about the assembly, such as quality metrics. This information will assist the expert assembly.
- **Stage 3: Expert Assembly**: Assembles the reads in an expert manner using information gathered during the previous stages.

Please see the [documentation](docs/tools/assemble.md) for more information about the assemble command.

### Command

```bash
proksee assemble -o output/directory FORWARD REVERSE
```

Where the argument provided after -o lets a user to specify a desired output directory. `FORWARD` and `REVERSE`  are fastq sequencing read files. If `REVERSE` is not specified, only single strand (`FORWARD`) is processed by the Proksee pipeline.  

### Example

```bash
proksee assemble -o output forward_reads.fastq reverse_reads.fastq
```

## Evaluate

The evaluate pipeline will evaluate the assembly quality of provided assembled contigs.

Please see the [documentation](docs/tools/evaluate.md) for more information about the evaluate command.

### Command

```bash
proksee evaluate -o output/directory CONTIGS
```

Where the argument provided after -o lets a user to specify a desired output directory. `CONTIGS` are FASTA-format assembled contigs.

### Example

```bash
proksee evaluate -o output assembly.fasta
```
